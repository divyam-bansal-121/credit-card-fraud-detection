# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It uses a dataset of credit card transactions and applies various models to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

## 🚀 Project Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## 📁 Dataset

> ⚠️ The original dataset `creditcard.csv` is too large for GitHub (143 MB).  
You can download it from [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## 🛠️ Installation
